Code Execution
--------------
To run the re-analysis, the user only needs to run script `MLTM_main`. This performs the first-level analysis (behaviour variable extraction and model inversion), and the second-level (group) analysis including model selection and parameter extraction as well plots of ANOVA results. Finally, this script also performs all the necessary stats - ANOVAs and Post-hoc t-tests - on the variables of interest - model-based and behaviour only.
